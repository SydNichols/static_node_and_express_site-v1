# Portfolio Site

A portfolio website built with Node.js, Express, and Pug templates.

## Style Customizations

I've made the following style customizations to personalize this project:

1. **Color Scheme**: Updated the color palette to use a modern blue-gray theme (#42557b) for the sidebar, buttons, and headings.

2. **Box Shadows**: Added subtle shadows to content boxes and thumbnails to create depth and visual hierarchy. Project thumbnails have a hover effect that lifts them slightly and enhances the shadow for a more interactive feel.

3. **Interactive Animations**: Added smooth transitions and subtle hover effects to buttons, links, and project titles to create a more dynamic and responsive feel when users interact with the site.
